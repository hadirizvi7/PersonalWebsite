					<h4>About Me</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>As a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computer Science with an strong interest and minor in Statistics, I enjoy solving problems and building software with real-world application. While majority of my experience and understanding revolves around Python and Java, I'm always willing to learn new languages and frameworks.</p>

					<p>Despite the fact that my previous experience lies within many different fields, including biochemistry and mathematics, I hope to continue to pursue my passion for software. Eventually, I would like to translate this passion into a full-time position as a software developer. I believe these previous experiences have enhanced my interpersonal skills and given me the capabilites to work in a wide variety of environments.</p>

					<h5>Future Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>Ideally, I would like to obtain relevant experience through an internship at a software company. Additionally, I would like to continue to build small projects (such as this website) and enhance my understanding of topics relevant to modern computer science (ex. machine learning, NLP, computer vision, etc.). </p>
				<p>In terms of academics, I am interested in attending a graduate institution following my undergraduate education. I hope to use the knowledge obtained in such a program to improve my technical skills. Moreover, I hope to utilize this information in order to improve my understanding/productivity in the industry.</p>
